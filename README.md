[![CI](https://github.com/felipejoglar/jetpack-compose-challenge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/felipejoglar/jetpack-compose-challenge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Jetpack Compose Android Challenge repository.

This is meant to be a learning playground project
for [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

It's based on the third Compose [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge),
which was
the [Speed Round](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-3.html)
and it is focused in the UI part of Compose. Leaving behind all
about [Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/architecture)
and [State Management](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state).

# The challenge
